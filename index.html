              <p class="card-text">          
               Suga is responsible for writing, composing and arranging, as well as mixing and mastering his material. Over 70 registered songs are credited to him by the Korea Music Copyright Association. He is a pianist, and produces hiphop and R&B music. His lyrics involve themes that are "full of dreams and hope," conceived with the intent of his music becoming "many people's strength." He cites Stony Skunk and Epik High as his inspirations to pursue hiphop music. Particularly, he credits the former's reggae-hiphop hybrid album Ragga Muffin (2005) and its title track for igniting his interest in the genre, calling it "completely different" from mainstream music.

               Jeff Benjamin of Fuse said Suga's mixtape "showcases the star's ear for hot productions, hardcore rap style, and how he can make his vulnerabilities a strength."

               In January 2018, Suga was promoted to full member of the Korea Music Copyright Association.
